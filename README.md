ECHOCHAIN
*The feed is a prison. Connection is the key.*
--
On a Tuesday in Albuquerque, the government deploys Chain-8886 through the water supply and a mandatory social media platform called Echofeed. Those who were already lost to the scroll—hollowed out by the addiction of infinite feeds—transform into the Feral. Predators. Hunters. Monsters wearing human skin.
But those who never looked? Those who stayed grounded in touch, in scent, in the ancient current that connects all living things? They become something else. The Free. Their essential natures amplified into power. Empaths who hear thoughts. Healers who mend with a touch. A DJ who bends gravity with bass drops. A man who summons fire with a flick of his fingers.
Charlie built the surveillance system that made this possible. Now, with iridescent eyes marking her as a target, she flees to a remote hacienda in the high desert—a sanctuary prepared by someone who knew this day would come. There, surrounded by friends in vintage YSL and Chanel tracksuits, she must forge bonds powerful enough to survive what's hunting them.
Because something ancient stirs in the shadows. Something beautiful and terrible. Something that wants them.
And the only way to fight the darkness is together.
